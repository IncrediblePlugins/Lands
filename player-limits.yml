# In this file you can configure numbered limits for all players.
# You can create multiple limit packs, if you want players to get different limits.
# A pack is assigned if the player has a specific permission.
# A player can only have one pack. Every time a player joins, the pack
# gets evaluated. If they have the permission for multiple packs, the pack last in the list of this file will be taken.
# You can disable limits by setting the value to -1. However, in general, it's recommended to set limits to prevent abuse.
# Changes to this file can be applied to all players, lands and nations, using the "/lands admin refreshlimits" command.
