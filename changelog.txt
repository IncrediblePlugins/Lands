+ Added: members attribute to levels.yml
See the default levels.yml for reference: https://github.com/IncrediblePlugins/Lands/blob/main/levels.yml

+ Changed: Reworked levels developer API. If you have 3rd party plugins that register custom levels or level requirements,
they must update to the new level API
