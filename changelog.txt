- Fixed: Cant enable disable-fly for combat tag
- Fixed: Invalid default days range for war declaration 1-7

  # Define when a declaration can be sent.
  send-time:
    # Day of the week. 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday.
    # Example: 1,2,3 -> Allows a declaration be sent on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.
    # Default: 1-7 -> Allows all days.
    days_range: "1-7"
    # Hours of the above defined days during which a declaration can be sent.
    hours_range: "0-23"

+ Added: [Suggestion] You can now restrict who can place capture flags
  # Should only be players with the MANAGE_WAR flag be able to place capture flags for their land?
  # If enabled, land owners can restrict who can place flags using the role system.
