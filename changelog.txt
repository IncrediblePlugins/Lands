+ Added: [Suggestion] You can now configure land creation to don't claim any chunks
    # Claim a radius of chunks at land creation. These initial claims won't cost the land anything.
    # NOTE: 0 = only the chunk in which the player currently stands.
    # NOTE: -1 = no chunks will be claimed
    # NOTE: This value can't be higher than your servers view distance.
    claim-radius: 1

- Fixed: Bedrock list menus always only having one item per page
