Added an option for that in wars.yml in the next version:

# Should players keep their inventory, if they die during a war?
keep-inventory: false


Also an important note there will be a option added in config.yml for outside of wars as well, you need to enable it if you want them to keep their inv if they die inside land claims.

  # Should players keep their inventory, if they die inside a land?
  # This option is forcefully enabled, if the player dies inside an area where they can't pickup items.
  # For wars this can be configured in wars.yml.
  keep-inventory: false


+ Changed: WorldEdit integration no longer has its own lands.bypass.worldedit permissions. Use the bypass permissions
for block break and block place instead.

- Fixed: Players being able to bypass area limit
