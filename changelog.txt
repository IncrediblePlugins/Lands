- Removed: Option for name tag force set on land creation: If you're on 1.21.9+ this is no longer needed since a dialog menu will open
instead at /lands create. If tags are enabled this dialog menu will be opened always. If tags are disabled, it will only be opened if the create command is executed without any argument: /lands create
- Fixed: Bodies with items not appearing for bedrock players in dialog menu (form)
