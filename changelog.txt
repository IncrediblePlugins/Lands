Captureflags have slightly changed:
- defenders only capture if more defenders than attackers are inside capture flag area
- attackers only capture if more attackers than attackers are inside capture flag area
- if amount of both teams is equal nobody captures

- Fixed: Missing GUI item failure_nation_none
- Fixed: expected rent block error
- Fixed: Saving player with too many invites
- Fixed: SQL transaction lock when deleting lands with Redis
- Fixed: Issues with bossbars at captureflags
