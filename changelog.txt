+ Added: Lands can now set tags for their land. A tag is the short version of the land name. Tags for nations will be added soon as well.
Please review the default tag settings in config.yml:
  # Land tag options
  tag:
    # Maximum land tag length
    # The maximum possible length is 80 when using MySQL and 32 when using SQLite (including color codes).
    length_3: 4
    # Should colors be allowed in land tags?
    # Disabling this option at a later time, will also remove color from existing lands.
    color_6: false
    # Should land tags be allowed to include formatting, such as bold, underlined etc.?
    format_2: false
    # Should numbers be allowed in land tags?
    numbers_2: false
    # Allow only latin letters for land tags?
    # If enabled: They won't be able to use chinese letters etc.
    only-latin_2: false

+ Added: Support for world resets and still keeping spawn locations in place and not adding another world to db if the name is the same as before
+ Added: wild.end message that is shown when a player tries to use random teleportation in the end
+ Changed: Parse PlaceholderAPI placeholders for sender of chat message, not recipient (/lands chat)
