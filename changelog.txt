+ Added: [Suggestion] You can now use wildcard "*" to add all MythicMobs mobs to the bypass spawn flags list in config:
    # Here you can add mob IDs from the MythicMobs plugin, that should bypass the animal and monster spawn flag.
    # The wildcard "*" adds all mobs of MythicMobs to this list.
    bypass-spawn-flags_list:
      - "*"

- Fixed: Error on join with playerprofile on spigot
